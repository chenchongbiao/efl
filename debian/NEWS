efl (1.26.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  This release includes some significant changes:

  * luajit support has been disabled on all architectures.  It's been
    progressively more fragile, and hasn't been the upstream default for a
    few releases.  This means that libelua1 is dropped; there are no rdeps
    outside of src:efl.

  * OpenSSL has been adopted as the crypto provider.  Since it's now
    considered a system library for purposes of the GPL's linking
    exception, there's no further reason to prefer GnuTLS - especially
    since it doesn't get much attention from EFL upstream.

efl (1.26.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

efl (1.23.2-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  This release includes significant changes:

  * autotools has been replaced by meson.  This results in numerous
    changes to how modules are built.
  * egl/gles is now the default on all architectures instead of just arm.
    Full OpenGL is no longer supported on Linux.
  * Wayland support is much improved.
